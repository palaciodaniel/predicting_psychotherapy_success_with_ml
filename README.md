# Predicting Psychotherapy Success (or Failure) with Machine Learning
This repository consists on a series of four Jupyter Notebooks (each one involving a specific Step) to create a Machine Learning model to predict whether a patient will finish or abandon a psychotherapeutic process, based on some personality attributes. 

The dataset consists on 100 observations, and although everything is completely fictional, it can still be potentially adapted to a real life situation.
